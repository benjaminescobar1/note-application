## Description

This note taker app allows users to save notes. It starts with a homepage that provides a link to the notes page. In the notes page the user can make a note title then type the note text they desire. Once they save the note, it will then store the note on the left hand side of the page. Server.js file can be used to launch a live server where users can save their notes. This file connects the back-end to the front-end files that were already given. When entering the notes, once saved, it returns all saved notes as JSON.
